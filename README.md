# Credit Scoring Experiment: Accuracy vs Calibration

A comprehensive experimental framework demonstrating the critical difference between model accuracy and calibration in credit risk assessment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project provides a hands-on demonstration of why **calibration** is as important as **accuracy** in machine learning applications that rely on probability estimates. Using credit scoring as a real-world example, we show how poorly calibrated models can lead to significant financial losses despite high accuracy scores.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Accuracy vs Calibration
- **Accuracy**: How often the model makes correct predictions (85% accuracy = 85% correct classifications)
- **Calibration**: How well predicted probabilities match actual outcomes (30% predicted risk should result in 30% actual defaults)

### Why This Matters
A model might correctly classify 90% of loan applications but predict 5% default risk when the actual rate is 25%. This overconfidence leads to:
- ❌ Poor business decisions
- 💰 Unexpected financial losses  
- ⚖️ Regulatory compliance issues
- 📊 Unreliable risk management

## 📊 Dataset

**German Credit Dataset** (UCI Repository)
- 1,000 credit applicants
- 20 features (age, credit history, employment, etc.)
- Binary target: Good credit (70%) vs Bad credit (30%)
- Publicly available and well-documented

**Remember**: In probability-sensitive applications, a well-calibrated model with 84% accuracy is often more valuable than a poorly calibrated model with 90% accuracy. This experiment proves why! 🎯
