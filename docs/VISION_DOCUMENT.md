# Credit Scoring Experiment: Accuracy vs Calibration
## Vision Document v1.0

### Executive Summary

This project demonstrates the critical distinction between model **accuracy** and **calibration** in machine learning, specifically within the context of credit risk assessment. While accuracy measures how often a model makes correct predictions, calibration measures how well predicted probabilities align with actual outcomes. This distinction has profound implications for business decisions, regulatory compliance, and risk management.

### Problem Statement

Many machine learning practitioners focus primarily on accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC) when evaluating models. However, in domains requiring probability-based decisions—such as credit scoring, medical diagnosis, or insurance underwriting—the reliability of predicted probabilities is equally important. A model might achieve 90% accuracy while being severely miscalibrated, leading to poor business decisions and financial losses.

### Vision Statement

**"To create a comprehensive, reproducible experiment that clearly demonstrates why calibration is as important as accuracy in probability-sensitive applications, providing both theoretical understanding and practical business insights."**
